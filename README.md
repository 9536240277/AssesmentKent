<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have NodeJS and React-Native installed in your system. You can find the instructions to install both of them on thier official website. 
We have two folders inside repository on backend and one frontend user need to run the below command in both for installation of the npm packages.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install 
  ```

### Installation

For connecting with the proper database and host user need to update the dbConnection.js file available in backend folder


Enter your database details in dbConnection.js
   ```js
   host = 'ENTER YOUR hostname';
   user = 'ENTER YOUR username';
   database = 'ENTER YOUR database';
   password = 'ENTER YOUR database password';
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

For running backend first user need to run the following command in backend folder:

* nodemon
  ```sh
  nodemon dbConnection 
  ```
For running frontend user need to run the following command in frontend folder:

* expo
  ```sh

  ```

And it will start the expo server in the web. And from there you can select the option to run in android emulator which will open the emulator for running the android app.
